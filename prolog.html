An other difference is that the body of the predicates is placed within a block.</p><p>For example, the (Turbo) Prolog :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    grandfather (X, Y) :-
        father (X, Z),
        father (Z, Y).</pre><p>Is in the prolog.r dialect :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    grandfather [X Y] [
        father [X Z]
        father [Z Y]
    ]</pre><p>This is simply because it's more simple to parse and manipulate block than strings in REBOL and also, because when you load your script, REBOL check missing brackets if any.</p><p>An other difference is that you can place REBOL code within your clauses. For example, to print out some information, you can do this :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    grandfather [X Y] [
        father [X Z]
        father [Z Y]
        (print [X &quot;is the grandfather of&quot; Y])
    ]</pre><p>You can also place REBOL script within the parameters of a predicate. For example the following clauses :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    sum [X Y (X + Y)]
    sum [X (Z - X) Z]
    sum [(Z - Y) Y Z]</pre><p>Will give back the third parameter when you give only two or check that the first plus the second equal the third when you give the three parameters.</p><p>The last difference, is that you can organize your knowledge into many base. To access to the clauses from one base to another, you must use path, for example :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    facts: assert none [
        father [marco paul]
        father [arnaldo marco]
    ]
    rules: assert none [
        grandfather [X Y] [
            facts/father [X Z]
            facts/father [Z Y]
        ]
    ]</pre><p>This can be usefull to organize your knowledge base, frequently one base for the rules (your logic) one base for the facts (the knowleddge base) and one base for the case (the deduction donefor the applied case).</p><p>Except these differences, the Prolog syntax is respected. Variables are word that begins with an uppercase letter or an underscore (_). Others words are considered as symbol. The CUT is available (CUT or !) and also the FAIL. CUT and FAIL are the only programed predicates. All others predifefined predicates are standard predicates.</p><h3><a id="sect1.3" name="sect1.3">1.3 Predifined predicates</a></h3><p>prolog.r offers a set of predefined predicates:</p><p><table width="85%" class="deftable"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>NOT</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>not [X] fails when X succeeds</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>EQUAL?</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>equal?[X Y] succeeds when X can be unified with Y</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>NOT-EQUAL?</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>not-equal? [X Y] fails when X can be unified with Y</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>IF</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>if [value] succeeds when the value is not none or false. 
If you want to test  REBOL script, place it within parenthesis, example if [(X &gt; Y)].</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>FREE</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>free [X] succeeds when X has no value, in other words, when X is none</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>BOUND</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>bound [X] succeeds when X has a value, in other words, when X is not none.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>ADD</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>add [X Y Z] succeeds when X + Y equals Z. With ADD you can do addition but also substraction (add [1 Y 3] return with Y set to 2)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>MULT</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>mult [X Y Z] succeeds when X * Y equals Z. Like with ADD, you can do multiplication but also division (mult [2 Y 8] return with Y set to 4]</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" class="defword" width="25%"><strong>REPEAT</strong></td><td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:justify"><p>repeat never fails. repeat [N] fails after N time successfull (usefull for loop)</p></td></tr></table></p><p>prolog.r offer also another facility which is very simple but quiet difficult to explain. An example is much more simple:</p><pre class="mdp-example">    mother [anne cathy]
    mother [cathy cindy]</pre><pre class="mdp-example">    display-all-mother [][
        mother? [X _]
        (print [X &quot;is a mother])
    ]</pre><p>In this example you can see that I didn't define the mother? predicates. I can do this because prolog.r defines it automaticaly in the following manner :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    mother? [X Y] [
        mother [X Y] !
    ]</pre><p>With this, the predicate succeeds (only one time due to the cut) if the predicate whitout the question mark (?) succeeds. This prevents you to define this kind of predicate.</p><h2><a id="sect2" name="sect2">2.

It's quiet few but this is mesured on predicate that you will never implement in prolog dialect. The usual bench to mesure LIPS is the NREV predicate (naive reverse of a list) :</p><pre class="mdp-example">    do %engine.r

I have no particular competence to build things like that and I make it with my own logic just for fun. Certainly a guy with all the necessary competences will make it much more faster and smaller.</p><p>You should also take prolog.r as an add-on to REBOL and use it only for non-deterministic logic. If you want to reverse a list, use the reverse REBOL function. It's why it was very important to be able to embed REBOL code within the clauses in a simple manner, as it was also important to invoke the goals easyly.</p><p>So I hope that the obtained performances are good enough for small part of a program where it's much more easy to specify the logic with clauses. And for the remaining part of the programm, we should write it with standard REBOL script.</p><p>Perhaps Carl will implement a native unify function which will be usefull for prolog.r but also for other REBOL script. In the same manner, if the find/match rafinement functioned on the blocks, prolog.r would be much faster. But this it's another story.</p><h2><a id="sect4" name="sect4">4. Conclusion</a></h2><p>When I was programming in Turbo Prolog, I found very tedious to write all the deterministic part of the program with clauses that you force to be deterministic with a lot of CUT.</p><p>I believe prolog.r, which allows the mix of REBOL and Prolog within the same script and with a syntax continuity, is a good base to write funny script with Logic Programming.</p><p>I hope you will have fun with it, Marco.</p></body> </html>
